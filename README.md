# MulticlassReviewClassification

## Preview

In short, this repository shows my steps in solving the task in several notebooks.

|  Notebook  |  Short Description  |
| --- | --- |
|  [EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/koren-v/MulticlassReviewClassification/blob/master/EDA.ipynb)  |  Includes some Data Analysis and attempts to find a correlation between the target and non-text fields.  |
|  [Two_Berts.ipynb](https://github.com/koren-v/MulticlassReviewClassification/blob/master/Two_Berts.ipynb)  | In this notebook I decided to train two separate models on subsample and save their predictions to use them as metafeatures for the next model. As Bert has goog enough vocabulary my text was just lowercased (by default) but wasn't been cleaned. –ês the main metric, I chose F1 score as the dataset is unbalanced.  |
|  [Ensemble.ipynb](https://github.com/koren-v/MulticlassReviewClassification/blob/master/Ensemble.ipynb)  |  Shows creating an ensembles:  simple voting and blending using KNN. This approaches gave same scores compearing with single models.  |
|  [Bert_for_Pair.ipynb](https://github.com/koren-v/MulticlassReviewClassification/blob/master/Bert_for_Pair.ipynb)  |  In this notebook I tried to put into Bert pairs of sentences separating them by special token as it was done during pre-training Bert. As a result, this model showed a much better score even than an ensemble. Except for the performance, one more benefit of this approach is that we don't need to save two or even three models for evaluating.  |

## Comparison

|  Model  |  Validation F1-score  |
| --- | --- |
|  Bert trained on 'reviewText' field  |  0.7728  |
|  Bert trained on 'summary' field  |  0.7041  |
|  Averaging of separate Berts  |  0.7660  |
|  Blending using KNN as final model  |  0.7716  |
|  Bert with two sentences as one input  |  0.8465  |
